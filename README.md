<h1> Home Constructions in the US and Future Outlook </h1> <br>

<br>


Motivation

Since the start of the pandemic (already year 3!), we have witnessed monumental changes in all aspects of our life. Major shifts towards much celebrated "work 
from home" culture and the consequent impact it has had on internal migration have led to a massive increase in demand for single-family homes across the US. 
We've all bore witness to the memes of New Yorkers taking over Florida and Californians taking over Texas. Albeit the sheer influx of residents to states like
Texas and Florida have been well documented, other smaller states have also felt the jolt of the pandemic and the consequent internal migration inflow.


Indubitably, states that saw an unprecedented population increase also faced inventory shortages in the housing market and a surge in average home prices. Internal migration has also caused the price of single-family homes to skyrocket in some regions. However, due to the influx of residential construction permits in the last two years and overall market exuberance, combined with the impending economic policy tightening to combat inflation and low-interest rates (FED Dual Mandate), I hypothesize that a large supply of newly-built homes will stabilize home prices and force investors to find specific trends in the market to avert unnecessary risks.
